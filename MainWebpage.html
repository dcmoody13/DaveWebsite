    <h3>On Authoritarians</h3>
    <p>Here is something on Authoritarians and Nationalists that is not completely thought through but I'm posting it
        just to get some content up here . . .
    </p>
    <p>
        A great advantage of progressives is this: your allies are everywhere. What I mean is this: If a defining
        characteristic of nationalists is to have some level of fear for what's outside your boarder and to feel
        self-righteousness in the solutions you want to impose on everyone else (see "The Authoritarians") then their
        alliances stay within whatever boarders they have constructed. They will certainly hate the conservatives in
        Iran and the conservatives in China and the conservatives in Venezuela (those radicals who want to preserve
        their power through the Chavista status quo – they are conservatives too). It's not enough to put your tribe
        first within its borders and live and let live as other countries do the same. Because if the glue that holds
        your movement together is fear, then in order for the powerful to stay in power you must be constantly
        reinforcing who your enemies are. you must hate the Iranians, and the Chinese and all Soviets because to hate
        them fuels your own power and position as a watchman and protector. (In addition to hating progressives who are
        also a threat to your nationalist-fueled power.

    </p>
    <p>But progressives can be found in any community. And they are not a threat to one another across boarders but a
        network, a strenghth to each other. So while nationalists in each nation include their local opponents and then
        the entire world as enemies or those with whom we have conflict, engaged even with "allies" in a zero-sum game,
        progressives are part of a humanity wide wavelenght of folks who see that things can be better, stronger
        together. And dare I suggest that this is where most of our human progress has emerged? </p>
    <p>
        There has been times past where tribalism was necessary for survival and if we are to believe the road warrior
        and its ilk, it may be necessary again. But maybe we can escape tribalisms gravity if we work together.
    </p>
    <p>I don't know what we do with this knowledge, but we can at least take comfort that there are others like us
        everywhere. </p> <p></p> <p></p> 
	<h3>A Note on Calories</h3> <p>To start off, I have a hugely 
disfunctional relationship with sugar and I think about it a lot. So there's that. But I always find it odd when
I read phrases like the following (from an article about eating and one's circadian rhythym): "In fact, some fascinating researtch has found that calories eatenn in the morning might not actually count as much as those eaten at night."(https://www.today.com/health/what-circadian-rhythm-diet-how-eat-sun-t149238)</p> 
<p>It's weird to me that we are trying not to make calories count, that we're here as a society when for almost all of our human (and biological and animal history) we have often desperately wanted to make every single calorie count for as much as we possibly can. Of course, when people talk with the idea of making "calories not counting" we are talking ultimatley about putting our body in a state where we are avoiding cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the like. But it seems funny to frame the problem in such a way as that, well, we are going to just eat a certain amount of calories and hopefully we can make some of them not count. As someone with a real sugar problem, I realizes that this framing minimizes the extreme struggle many of us go through as particular types of food are tied so closely to social events, psychological comfort, necessary conveinence in a world that demands much of our time, and fuel to be laregly still but very alert for those work at mentally demanding desk jobs. But while acknowledging the problem we're in, in there a better way to acknowledge it than by this formulation where we don't want calories to count?</p>
<p>As someone who loves efficiency, from an efficiency point of view, I want my calories to count as much as each one possibly can. If I were driving a car across the desert, I'd want it to be as fuel efficient as possible and I wouldn't mind if I had a extra fuel in that car if it made me flexible for an unknown journey. Now of course we don't live in that world. Calories are plentiful and there's a social premium on the construct of a sculpted body, which might be generally less helpful in a long term survival emergency. So the question is, what are we really asking of our calories? For me, the answer is not that they should not count, but to ask *how* they should count. At some points your body is in a mode to save them (put on fat) when what you would really like is to use it to be clear adn sharp and focused for a project you're working on. So in that moment, you desperately want that calorie to count to help you work (and to feel good while you are doing it).</p>
<p>Again, I don't want to make this a matter of semantics (we know that by not making a calorie count they mean as storage on your body) because I don't think it is. We need calories but the question for many of us is why we feel compelled to eat if we don't need to or alternatley, why they aren't giving us the right energy or mental acuity when we want them to.</p>
